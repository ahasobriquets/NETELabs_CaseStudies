\section*{Abstract}

Drug discovery and the subsequent availability of new breakthrough therapeutics or `cures' are compelling examples of societal benefit from advances in research. Such advances are invariably collaborative, involving the contributions of many scientists in a `cure network' where prior theory and experiment is built upon. Data mining of public and commercial data sources coupled with network analysis is a scalable digital methodology for assembling and analyzing the history of scientific advances. This methodology is extensible beyond cure networks and its use supports (i) efficiency in  exploring  the scientific history of a research advance (ii) improved documenting and understanding of collaboration (iii) portfolio analysis, planning and optimization (iv) communication of the societal value of research. Building upon prior techniques for single cure networks and linking the work of approximately 200,000 authors in 100,000 scientific publications, we have conducted a case study of five anti-cancer therapeutics for the purpose of exploring the relationship across networks. We have enriched the content of these five networks by annotating them with information on research awards as well as peer review that preceded these awards. Applying retrospective citation discovery, we have identified a core set of publications cited in the networks of all five therapeutics and additional intersections in combinations of networks as well as a core set of awards from the National Institutes of Health that supported this research. Lastly, we have mapped these awards to their cognate peer review panels, identifying another layer of collaborative scientific activity that influenced the research represented by these networks.

\section*{Introduction}

Data mining of public data sources coupled with network analysis allows the assembly and quantitative description of research discoveries that were influential in the development of a breakthrough therapeutic or `cure'.  The set of scientific publications, clinical trials, patents, and regulatory approvals, linked to each other by citation or assignment, that documents progress from basic research to a cure is termed a `cure network' \cite {bib1}. Key assumptions in constructing these networks are that the references found in relevant documents are appropriate citations of new knowledge relevant to a given cure and that a further retrospective round of citation discovery will uncover previous influential discovery (\textit{ibid}). Williams and colleagues have elegantly demonstrated the feasibility of this approach using, as case studies, ivacaftor and ipilimumab, approved for the treatment of cystic fibrosis and melanoma respectively (\textit{vide supra}). These authors observed that `the nature of a cure discovery network is complex and fundamentally collaborative', noting in the case of ivacaftor, that at least 7,067 scientists with 5,666 unique affiliations contributed to ivacaftor-related research over a period greater than 100 years. 

Such studies provide evidence for the broad collaborative platform of basic and translational research underlying major scientific advances such as cures for diseases, support strategic communications to oversight bodies, and communication of the societal value of research\cite {bib2,bib3}. Extending this digital methodology to study additional cures as well as significant research advances in general is a logical next step. Ascertaining the nature of the interactions, if any, between networks, is also of considerable interest since it would support an understanding of collaboration across networks as well as common features of science networks.  

To address these questions, we have conducted case studies of a cluster of five FDA-approved therapeutics for cancer. We have extended the original approach to (i) include a data from a commercially available bibliographic database with disambiguated author identifiers (ii) modified the original data mining methods and network metrics (iii) added new node types to include grants and peer review data (iv) refactored the network analysis code of Williams et al. for better performance. (v) mapped publications and authors across all five networks. 

We present the results of these case studies as a step towards mapping the universe of FDA-approved drugs and biologicals. Beyond drug discovery and cures, however, this simple digital methodology can be used to support efficient explorations of science history, gain an understanding of collaboration across domains, enrich portfolio analysis, planning and optimization, enable communications of the societal value of research, and help make the scientific environment more citizen-accessible. 

\section*{Materials and Methods} 
% Place tables after the first paragraph in which they are cited.
A set of five anti-cancer therapeutics, three drugs and two biologicals, approved for use in humans by the Food and Drug Administration was selected for this study (Table 1). Imatinib and Sunitinib are tyrosine kinase inhibitors, Nelarabine is a nucleoside analog, and Ramucirumab and Alemtuzumab are humanized antibodies that target cell surface receptors. 
 For each of these therapeutics, a set of relevant scientific publications was constructed as in Williams et al.\cite{bib1} but with specific modifications detailed below. An allowance of 2 months was made for `publication lag' when assembling referenced material. For example, if a therapeutic was approved on Jan 1, 2017, documents published  on or before March 31, 2017 were included. For each of the five therapeutics, a first-generation list of PubMed identifiers (citing\_pmid) was harvested from the five different data sources (below).

{\bf Case Studies of Five Anti-Cancer Agents} Five anti-cancer therapeutics, with FDA approval dates ranging from 2001 to 2014, were selected as case studies. The active ingredient for each of these five therapeutics is listed in column 1. While multiple patents are typically associated with a drug or biological, the single US patent number displayed represents the primary invention that preceded approval of the therapeutic. The publication date for each patent is listed in the last column.}

\end{table}

\textbf{Clinical trials} The national clinical trials database (clinicaltrials.gov) was searched for clinical trials of the five therapeutics that completed on or the data of FDA approval. Both cited references and publications from these clinical trials were collected if they were published within the approval date plus two months. To capture publications associated with the clinical trials that were not displayed in clinical trials.gov, PubMed was also searched with the unique identifier (NCT number) of any clinical trials that were identified. To capture publications of clinical trials not registered in clinicaltrials.gov, PubMed was searched using the therapeutic name as keyword, publication type as ``clinical trial'', and an appropriate date restriction as in searches of clinicaltrials.gov. For example, the search term (((``alemtuzumab"[Supplementary Concept] OR ``alemtuzumab"[All Fields]) OR (``alemtuzumab"[Supplementary Concept] OR ``alemtuzumab"[All Fields] OR ``campath"[All Fields])) AND (``1900/0101"[PDAT] : ``2001/07/31''[PDAT])) AND ``clinical trial"[Publication Type] was used to identify publications of clinical trials for Alemtuzumab.

\textbf{FDA documents} The drugs@fda website\cite{bib6} was searched for each of the five therapeutics and cited references in the medical review document were manually extracted and matched to pmids. FDA Approval Summaries, articles published in journals by FDA staff, were available for all five therapeutics and contain cited references. If the published date of a citation exceeded the approval date plus two months, the publication was not included.

\textbf{Patents} For each therapeutic a single patent was identified that best represented the most relevant invention to the therapeutic at hand. Identification of this patent was performed using multiple web sources. The US patent number was then used to identify the patent and the non-patent citation list from Google Patents \cite{bib8} was manually processed by searching PubMed for appropriate pmids. While we developed a citation matching tool for non-patent literature for this purpose, the accuracy of manual searches was far higher and were used to generate the data in this study.

\textbf{Post-approval literature reviews} Review articles published after a therapeutic's approval by the FDA are independent assessments of the the development of a therapeutic. Accordingly, PubMed was searched for review articles of a therapeutic that were published between the date of FDA approval and one year following the date of approval and cited references in these reviews were extracted using PubMed and Scopus.

\textbf{Pre-approval literature searches} Literature searches were performed using PubMed with a date range of 1900/01/01 to two months post-FDA approval. For example, the search term ((alemtuzumab) OR campath) AND (``1900/01/01"[Date - Publication] : ``2001/07/31"[Date - Publication]) was used to retrieve articles of interest relevant to alemtuzumab.

Citing\_pmids from the five different sources above  were combined and deduplicated. Using the Scopus database and its APIs, these citing\_pmids were mapped to Scopus identifiers (citing\_sid) from which a second generation of cited references (cited\_sid) was extracted., These cited\_sids, were in turn, mapped back to pmids (cited\_pmid). Whereas mapping between PubMed and Scopus identifiers at the citing\_pmid and citing\_sid stage resulted in 1\% or less information loss, mapping at the cited\_sid to cited\_pmid resulted in 15-20 \% information loss. Accordingly the Scopus data  was used as the backbone of the publication component of the network and the cited\_pmid information was treated as an annotation layer.  These observations are summarized in Table 2 and include the count of null values when mapping from citing\_sid to cited\_sid.

Citing and cited pmids were both mapped to NIH grants and peer review panels using information made publicly available by NIH through NIH ExPORTER. Since Special Emphasis Panels vary in scientific interests from year to year, we restricted our mapping to chartered study sections, which have defined scientific interests and relatively stable reviewer membership. The resultant data were modeled as hierarchical networks and analyzed using metrics based on network topology. We calculated the propagated in-degree rank (PIR) metric of Williams \cite {bib1}. PIR represents the sum of weighted citation scores for all articles in a network that can be attributed to an author. In addition to computing PIR for all authors in each network, we also combined the citation data for all five networks and computed a globalPIR score, which was normalized to the sum of PIR scores within each network.

We also calculated the RBR metric of Williams et al. (\textit{ibid}) with some modifications. The RBR metric is intended to represent the fraction of a researcher's output that is in a network and is defined as the ratio of the number of publications in network to the number of publications in a background dataset for an author. In its original specification, the background dataset for RBR was constructed by keyword searches of PubMed. A potential weakness of this keyword based approach is that keywords do not effectively capture the field or the total output of an author even if multiple background samples are taken. Therefore, we created two new variants of the RBR; network RBR (nRBR) and document-based RBR (dRBR). nRBR uses all publications in our set of five therapeutics as background and dRBR takes advantage of the Scopus author\_id to capture the total output of an author and use it as background. Thus, nRBR and dRBR normalize a researcher's in-network contributions to backgrounds based on total network and total researcher productivity respectively.\\

\item $wc_n(\mathfrak{p})$  weighted citation of a publication $\mathfrak{p}$ in a network $n$
\item $\mathcal{A}_\mathfrak{a}^n$ the set of publications for an author $\mathfrak{a}$ in a network $n$
\item $pir_n(\mathfrak{a})$ the PIR  score of an author in a Network $n$ in $\mathcal{M}$
\item $npir(\mathfrak{a})$ the PIR score of an author  $\mathfrak{a}$ in the Network  $\mathcal{N}$ 
\item $ir(\mathfrak{a})$ partitioning of a research metric for an author $\mathfrak{a}$ 
\item $ic_{d_i}(\mathfrak{a})$ = total \# in-degree count for an author $\mathfrak{a}$  for drug $d_i$. (ie. = $\|\mathcal{A}_\mathfrak{a}^{d_i}\|$)
\item $ic_n(\mathfrak{a})$ = total \# in-degree count for an author $\mathfrak{a}$  in  $\mathcal{N}$ (i.e = $\|\mathcal{A}_\mathfrak{a}^{N}\|$)
\item $ nrbr_{d_i}(\mathfrak{a}) $ modified RBR score normalized to its network $\mathcal{N}$ for a drug $d_i$
\item $ grbr_{d_i}(\mathfrak{a}) $ modified RBR score normalized to the global network $\mathcal{G}$  for a drug $d_i$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{PIR Score}: We define the global network $\mathcal{N}$ as the union of the each individual sub-network of a therapeutic $d_i$. In other words 
$$ \mathcal{N} = \cup_{i =1}^{5} \mathcal{N}_i $$
Let $c_n(\mathfrak{p})$ be the citation score of the the paper $\mathfrak{p}$ in a network $n$, and $\mathcal{C}_\mathfrak{p}^n$ be the set of publication which cites $\mathfrak{p}$. Then we define the weighted citation of a paper $\mathfrak{p}$ as $$wc_n(\mathfrak{p}) = c_n(\mathfrak{p}) + \sum_{g\in \mathcal{C}_\mathfrak{p}^n}  c_n(g) $$
Let $\mathcal{A}_a^n$ be the set of publications for an author $\mathfrak{a}$ in a Network $n$. Then the PIR score  for an author $\mathfrak{a}$  in network $n$ is defined as $$ pir_n(\mathfrak{a}) =  \sum_{p\in \mathcal{A}_a^n}  wc_n(\mathfrak{p}) $$

More simply, the PIR score for an author  $\mathfrak{a}$ in a Network $n$ is  $$ pir_n(\mathfrak{a}) =  \sum_{p\in \mathcal{A}_a^n } \big[c_n(p) + \sum_{g\in \mathcal{C}_\mathfrak{p}^n}  c_n(g)\big] $$

Next we define the nPIR score $npir(\mathfrak{a})$, which is $pir$ score based on the  total network $\mathcal{N}$. For convenience, instead of denoting it $pir_N$, we use $npir$   Furthermore  we define the isolation of  research  metric $ir(\mathfrak{a}):\mathcal{R}\rightarrow [1,\infty]$  of an author $\mathfrak{a}$ as 
$$ir(\mathfrak{a})= \dfrac{ npir({\mathfrak{a}})} {\sum_{1}^{5} pir_{d_i}(\mathfrak{a})} $$
where $\mathcal{R}$ is the set of all authors in $\mathcal{N}$  and  $pir_{d_i}(\mathfrak{a})$ is the PIR score of the author $\mathfrak{a}$ restricted to only drug network $\mathcal{D}_i$ . If $ir(\mathfrak{a})$ approaches 1, the author's $\mathfrak{a}$ contribution to each drug is partitioned. The greater the $ir$, the closer  the interaction of the author's papers between the networks. 

\textbf{RBR Score}:
\begin{itemize}
\item nRBR or network RBR is the ratio of an authors' count of publications in a network to the total number of the publications in the global Network. 
Lets define in-degree count $ic_{d_i}(\mathfrak{a})$ of an author $\mathfrak{a}$ as the total number of the publication which is in the network $\mathcal{N}_i$ of the drug $d_i$, similarly lets $ic_{n}$ be the number of the paper that author $\mathfrak{a}$ published in the total Network(5-drug's network) $\mathcal{N}$. Then we define, nRBR of an author $\mathfrak{a}$  for a drug $d_i$ as follow.
$$ nrbr_{d_i}(\mathfrak{a}) = \dfrac{ic_{d_i}(\mathfrak{a})}{ic_{N}(\mathfrak{a})}$$
\item gRBR or global RBR is the ratio of an author's count of publications in a network to the author's total publication count. $\mathcal{G}$. Thus, $grbr$ score of an author  $\mathfrak{a}$  for the drug $d_i$ is defined as 
$$grbr_{d_i}(\mathfrak{a}) = \dfrac{ic_{d_i}(\mathfrak{a})}{ic_{G}(\mathfrak{a})}$$
where $ic_{G}$ is the total number of publication that an author $\mathfrak{a}$ currently has.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Results and Discussion}

Scientific publications form the backbone of each of these five networks. The initial assumptions of appropriate citation and retrospective citation discovery (Introduction) suggest that network nodes that are common to multiple networks are likely to be influential. Accordingly. we explored the extent and nature of intersections across networks, we calculated intersection counts for all possible combinations of Alemtuzumab, Imatinib, Nelarabine, Ramucirumab, and Sunitinib (Table 3). 14 publications are cited in all five networks and are shown in Table 4.

\caption{{\bf Citation Counts and Mapping Between Bibliographic Databases} Five anti-cancer therapeutics were selected as case studies. A foundational set of references (citing\_pmid) was assembled for each therapeutic from patents, clinical trials, regulatory documents, and the scientific literature. Citing\_pmids were mapped to Scopus identifiers (citing\_sid), which were used, in turn, to retrieve literature cited by this foundational set (cited\_sid). Cited\_sids were mapped back to PubMed identifiers (cited\_pmid).The number of  identifiers at each stage of the mapping process is shown along with percentage loss (in parentheses) when mapping across PubMed and Scopus or due to null values in the cited\_sid field} 
\label{table4}
\end{adjustwidth}
\end{table}

Thus, we also applied intersection analysis as above at a finer level of granularity by computing intersection counts for first generation citations (citing\_pmid) and second generation citations (cited\_sid). The results are displayed as Venn diagrams in Figures 1 and 2 respectively. Strikingly, no publications are common to all five networks at the first generation level although a single publication, the highly influential work of Kohler and Milstein\cite{bibKohler}, is cited in four out of five networks. All 14 publications cited in our set of five networks were in the second generation of citations and another 198 were found  across various the four-network combinations, roughly an order of magnitude greater than the case of cited references.  We manually grouped the 14 publications using high level descriptive terms and noted statistical techniques (5 publications), molecular and cell biological methods (4), analytical and structural biochemistry techniques (3) and cancer biology (2). Of these last two, one is a review of the p53 gene [cite] and the second is a study of angiogenesis in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia [cite]. Thus, the majority of this small set of 14 publications concerns methods that are heavily cited in these therapeutic development networks. We are actively working on characterizing the entire dataset as well as intersecting subsets using methods that would scale to thousands of publications and these results will be shared in another publication [needs to be reworded].
