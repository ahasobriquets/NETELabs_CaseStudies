\section*{Abstract}

Scientific advances such as development of a new drug or biological are collaborative and involve the contributions of many scientists.  Data mining and network analysis of public and commercial data sources can be used to describe the set of collaborative activities or `cure networks' that result in new therapeutics. To explore the relationship across cure networks- the extent to which nodes are common across networks, we have conducted case studies of five anti-cancer therapeutics. We have mined data drawn from public and commercial sources, constructed linkages based on unique identifiers, and modeled the data as networks. We have enriched the content of these networks by annotating them with information on awards that supported the research in these networks as well as peer review that preceded these awards. This approach can be extended beyond drug development to study any major scientific advance. Such studies support portfolio analysis and a public understanding of the benefits of research, this methodology can be extended beyond cures to scientific advances in general. [In fact we're talking about the digital transformation of science history scholarship].[These studies help us understand that which came before and leave it in a form that others can use].[cite Jean-Michel Maldame's work]

\section*{Introduction}

Data mining of public data sources coupled with network analysis allows the assembly and quantitative description of research discoveries that were influential in the development of a breakthrough therapeutic or `cure' \cite {bib1}.  The set of scientific publications, clinical trials, patents, and regulatory approvals, linked to each other by citation or assignment, that documents progress from basic research to a cure is termed a `cure network'. Key assumptions in constructing these networks are that the references found in relevant documents are appropriate citations of new knowledge relevant to a given cure and that a further retrospective round of citation discovery will uncover previous influential discovery (\textit{ibid}). 

Williams and colleagues have elegantly demonstrated the feasibility of this approach using, as case studies, ivacaftor and ipilimumab, approved for the treatment of cystic fibrosis and melanoma respectively (\textit{vide supra}). These authors observed that `the nature of a cure discovery network is complex and fundamentally collaborative', noting in the case of ivacaftor, that at least 7,067 scientists with 5,666 unique affiliations contributed to ivacaftor-related research over a period greater than 100 years. Such studies provide evidence for the  broad collaborative platform of basic and translational research underlying major scientific advances such as cures for diseases, support strategic communications to oversight bodies, and communication of the societal value of research \cite {bib2}. 

Extending the methodology to study additional cures as well as other significant research advances is a logical next step. Ascertaining the nature of the interactions, if any, between networks, is also of considerable interest since it would support an understanding of common features of science networks as well as research events that have been influential across multiple networks. 

To address these questions, we have conducted case studies of a cluster of five FDA-approved therapeutics for cancer. We have extended the original approach to (i) include a data from a commercially available bibliographic database with disambiguated author identifiers (ii) modified the original data mining methods and network metrics (iii) added new node types to include grants and peer review data (iv) refactored the network analysis code of Williams et al. for better performance. (v) mapped publications and authors across all five networks. We present the results of these case studies as a step towards mapping the universe of FDA-approved drugs and biologicals.

\section*{Materials and Methods}

A set of five anti-cancer therapeutics, three drugs and two biologicals, approved for use in humans between 2001 and 2014, were chosen for this study (Table 1). Imatinib and Sunitinib are tyrosine kinase inhibitors, Nelarabine is a nucleoside analog, and Ramucirumab and Alemtuzumab are humanized antibodies that target cell surface receptors. 


For each of these therapeutics, a set of relevant citations was constructed based on the assumptions articulated by Williams et al. but with specific modifications detailed below. An allowance of 2 months was also made for `publication lag' when assembling referenced material. For example, if a therapeutic was approved on Jan 1, 2017, documents published  on or before March 31, 2017 were included. A first generation of citations was created as a list of PubMed IDs (pmids) harvested from seven different data sources (below).  
\begin {itemize}
\item Clinical trials. The national clinical trials database (clinicaltrials.gov) was searched for clinical trials of the five therapeutics that completed on or the data of FDA approval. Both cited references and publications from these clinical trials were collected if they were published within the approval date plus two months period. PubMed was also searched with the unique identifier (NCT number) of any clinical trials that were identified to capture publications associated with the clinical trials that were not displayed in clinical trials.gov. To capture clinical trials publications that are not available in clinicaltrials.gov, PubMed was searched using the therapeutic name as keyword, publication type as "clinical trial", and an appropriate date restriction as in searches of clinicaltrials.gov. For example, the search term ((("alemtuzumab"[Supplementary Concept] OR "alemtuzumab"[All Fields]) OR ("alemtuzumab"[Supplementary Concept] OR "alemtuzumab"[All Fields] OR "campath"[All Fields])) AND ("1900/0101"[PDAT] : "2001/07/31"[PDAT])) AND "clinical trial"[Publication Type] was used to identify publications typed as clinical trials for Alemtuzumab that were published on or before July 31, 2001.

\item Regulatory documents. drugs@fda (https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/) was searched for each of the five therapeutics and cited references in the medical review of the approval process were manually extracted and matched to pmids.

\item FDA Approval Summaries. These articles published in journals by FDA staff (approval summaries were available for all five therapeutics), contain cited references that were extracted using Scopus. approval summaries were available for all five therapeutics. If the published date of a citation exceeded the approval date plus two months, the publication was not included.

\item Patents. For each therapeutic a single patent was identified that best represented the most relevant invention to the therapeutic at hand. Identification of a patent was performed using multiple web sources: PubMed, Google Patents, EspaceNet, and drugbank.ca. The US patent number was used to identify the patent and the non-patent citation list from Google patent was manually processed by searching PubMed for appropriate pmids. While we developed a citation matching tool for non-patent literature, the precision and recall rates from manual searches was far higher and were used to generate the data in this study.

\item Reviews: We treated review articles published after FDA approval  as independent documents describing the development of a therapeutic. Accordingly, PubMed was searched for review articles of a therapeutic that were published between the date of FDA approval and one year following the date of approval. Cited references in these reviews were also extracted as above.

\item Literature searches were also performed using PubMed with a date range of 1900/01/01 to two months post-FDA approval. For example, the search term ((alemtuzumab) OR campath) AND ("1900/01/01"[Date - Publication] : "2001/07/31"[Date - Publication]) was used to retrieve articles of interest relevant to alemtuzumab.
\end{itemize}

Pmids from the seven different sources above (citing\_pmid) were combined, deduplicated, and matched to Scopus IDs (citing\_eid) using Scopus APIs. These eids were used to extract cited references (cited\_eid), which were then mapped back to pmids (cited\_pmid). The data are summarized in Table 2. Using the Scopus database, this list was mapped to Scopus eids and a second generation of cited references was extracted. These were mapped to pmids First and second generation pmids were both mapped to NIH grants and peer review data using information made publicly available by NIH. The resultant data were modeled as hierarchical networks using a simple dictionary of N node types to unambiguously identify nodes and interactions between them. The networks were analyzed using metrics based on network topology.

Available awards (projects) and link tables publications up to 2016 were downloaded from NIH ExPORTER and used to link publications to NIH awards and study sections where grant applications were reviewed for scientific merit before an award was made. The assembled data were modeled as a network for each therapeutic and stored as node lists and edge lists. 
exporter

For these data, we calculated the propagated in-degree rank (PIR) and ratio of basic rankings (RBR) metrics of Williams \cite {bib1}  with some modifications to the RBR as follows. The original RBR was defined as the ratio of the number of publications in network to the number of publications in a background dataset for an author. The background dataset was constructed by keyword searches of PubMed. However, a potential weakness of the keyword based approach is that keywords do not effectively capture the field or the total ouput of an author even if multiple background samples are taken. We created two new variants, nRBR and dRBR. nRBR uses all publications in our set of five therapeutics as background. dRBR takes advantage of the Scopus author\_id to capture the total output of an author and use it as background. 

Citation data for all five networks were combined and a globalPIR score was calculated. The globalPIR score was normalized to the sum of PIR scores within each network.
