TI  - FDA drug approval summary: nelarabine (Arranon) for the treatment of T-cell
      lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma.

AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the clinical trials leading to U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) approval of nelarabine (Arranon), a new purine analogue, for
      the treatment of patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and
      T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) whose disease has not responded to or has
      relapsed following treatment with at least two chemotherapy regimens.
      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Two phase II trials, one conducted in pediatric patients and
      the other in adult patients, were reviewed. Patients were in their first or
      subsequent relapse and/or were refractory to first-line therapy. The dose and
      schedule of i.v. nelarabine in the pediatric and adult studies were 650 mg/m2 per
      day daily for 5 days and 1,500 mg/m2 i.v. on days 1, 3, and 5, respectively.
      Treatments were repeated every 21 days. Study endpoints were the rates of
      complete response (CR) and CR with incomplete hematologic or bone marrow recovery
      (CR*). RESULTS: The pediatric efficacy population consisted of 39 patients who
      had relapsed after, or had been refractory to, two or more induction regimens. CR
      to nelarabine treatment was observed in five patients (13%) and CR+CR* was
      observed in nine patients (23%). The adult efficacy population consisted of 28
      patients. CR to nelarabine treatment was observed in five patients (18%) and
      CR+CR* was observed in six patients (21%). Neurologic toxicity was dose limiting
      for both pediatric and adult patients. Other severe toxicities included
      hematologic, hepatic, and metabolic laboratory abnormalities in pediatric
      patients and gastrointestinal and pulmonary toxicities in adults. CONCLUSIONS: On
      October 28, 2005, the FDA granted accelerated approval for nelarabine for
      treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory T-ALL/T-LBL after at least two
      prior regimens. This use is based on the induction of CR. The applicant will
      conduct postmarketing clinical trials to demonstrate clinical benefit, for
      example, survival prolongation.
