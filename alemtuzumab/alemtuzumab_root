AB  - On September 19, 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted regular
      approval and expanded labeling for alemtuzumab (Campath); Genzyme Corporation,
      Cambridge, MA) as single-agent treatment for B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia
      (B-CLL). Alemtuzumab was initially approved in 2001 under accelerated approval
      regulations. Conversion to regular approval was based on a single study submitted
      to verify clinical benefit. Efficacy and safety were demonstrated in an
      open-label, international, multicenter, randomized trial of 297 patients with
      previously untreated, Rai stage I-IV B-CLL experiencing progression of their
      disease. Patients were randomized to either alemtuzumab, 30 mg i.v. over 2 hours
      three times per week on alternate days for a maximum of 12 weeks, or
      chlorambucil, 40 mg/m(2) orally every 28 days for a maximum of 12 months. The
      progression-free survival time, the primary study endpoint, was significantly
      longer in the alemtuzumab arm than in the chlorambucil arm. Both the overall and
      complete response rates were also significantly higher in the alemtuzumab arm. No
      differences in survival were observed. There were no new safety signals
      identified in patients receiving alemtuzumab. The most serious, and sometimes
      fatal, toxicities of alemtuzumab are cytopenias, infusion reactions, and
      infections.
