TI  - FDA Approval Summary: Ramucirumab for Gastric Cancer.
PG  - 3372-6
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-15-0600 [doi]
AB  - The FDA approved ramucirumab (CYRAMZA; Eli Lilly and Company) for previously
      treated patients with advanced or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction
      adenocarcinoma initially as monotherapy (April 21, 2014) and subsequently as
      combination therapy with paclitaxel (November 5, 2014). In the monotherapy trial,
      355 patients in the indicated population were randomly allocated (2:1) to receive
      ramucirumab or placebo, 8 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks. In the combination
      trial, 665 patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive ramucirumab or
      placebo, 8 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks, in combination with paclitaxel, 80
      mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15 of 28-day cycles. Overall survival (OS) was
      increased in patients who received ramucirumab in both the monotherapy [HR, 0.78;
      95% confidence interval (CI), 0.60-0.998; log rank P = 0.047] and combination
      trials (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.68-0.96; P = 0.017). The most common adverse
      reactions were hypertension and diarrhea in the monotherapy trial and fatigue,
      neutropenia, diarrhea, and epistaxis in the combination trial. Because of
      concerns about the robustness of the monotherapy trial results, FDA approved the
      original application after receiving the results of the combination trial
      confirming the OS effect. Based on exploratory exposure-response analyses, there
      is residual uncertainty regarding the optimal dose of ramucirumab.
