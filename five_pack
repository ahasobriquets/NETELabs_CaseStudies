TI  - FDA Approval Summary: Ramucirumab for Gastric Cancer.
PG  - 3372-6
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-15-0600 [doi]
AB  - The FDA approved ramucirumab (CYRAMZA; Eli Lilly and Company) for previously
      treated patients with advanced or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction
      adenocarcinoma initially as monotherapy (April 21, 2014) and subsequently as
      combination therapy with paclitaxel (November 5, 2014). In the monotherapy trial,
      355 patients in the indicated population were randomly allocated (2:1) to receive
      ramucirumab or placebo, 8 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks. In the combination
      trial, 665 patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive ramucirumab or
      placebo, 8 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks, in combination with paclitaxel, 80
      mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15 of 28-day cycles. Overall survival (OS) was
      increased in patients who received ramucirumab in both the monotherapy [HR, 0.78;
      95% confidence interval (CI), 0.60-0.998; log rank P = 0.047] and combination
      trials (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.68-0.96; P = 0.017). The most common adverse
      reactions were hypertension and diarrhea in the monotherapy trial and fatigue,
      neutropenia, diarrhea, and epistaxis in the combination trial. Because of
      concerns about the robustness of the monotherapy trial results, FDA approved the
      original application after receiving the results of the combination trial
      confirming the OS effect. Based on exploratory exposure-response analyses, there
      is residual uncertainty regarding the optimal dose of ramucirumab.

TI  - FDA drug approval summary: nelarabine (Arranon) for the treatment of T-cell
      lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma.
PG  - 709-14
LID - 10.1634/theoncologist.2006-0017 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the clinical trials leading to U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) approval of nelarabine (Arranon), a new purine analogue, for
      the treatment of patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and
      T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) whose disease has not responded to or has
      relapsed following treatment with at least two chemotherapy regimens.
      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Two phase II trials, one conducted in pediatric patients and
      the other in adult patients, were reviewed. Patients were in their first or
      subsequent relapse and/or were refractory to first-line therapy. The dose and
      schedule of i.v. nelarabine in the pediatric and adult studies were 650 mg/m2 per
      day daily for 5 days and 1,500 mg/m2 i.v. on days 1, 3, and 5, respectively.
      Treatments were repeated every 21 days. Study endpoints were the rates of
      complete response (CR) and CR with incomplete hematologic or bone marrow recovery
      (CR*). RESULTS: The pediatric efficacy population consisted of 39 patients who
      had relapsed after, or had been refractory to, two or more induction regimens. CR
      to nelarabine treatment was observed in five patients (13%) and CR+CR* was
      observed in nine patients (23%). The adult efficacy population consisted of 28
      patients. CR to nelarabine treatment was observed in five patients (18%) and
      CR+CR* was observed in six patients (21%). Neurologic toxicity was dose limiting
      for both pediatric and adult patients. Other severe toxicities included
      hematologic, hepatic, and metabolic laboratory abnormalities in pediatric
      patients and gastrointestinal and pulmonary toxicities in adults. CONCLUSIONS: On
      October 28, 2005, the FDA granted accelerated approval for nelarabine for
      treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory T-ALL/T-LBL after at least two
      prior regimens. This use is based on the induction of CR. The applicant will
      conduct postmarketing clinical trials to demonstrate clinical benefit, for
      example, survival prolongation.

TI  - FDA drug approval summary: alemtuzumab as single-agent treatment for B-cell
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
PG  - 167-74
LID - 10.1634/theoncologist.2007-0218 [doi]
AB  - On September 19, 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted regular
      approval and expanded labeling for alemtuzumab (Campath); Genzyme Corporation,
      Cambridge, MA) as single-agent treatment for B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia
      (B-CLL). Alemtuzumab was initially approved in 2001 under accelerated approval
      regulations. Conversion to regular approval was based on a single study submitted
      to verify clinical benefit. Efficacy and safety were demonstrated in an
      open-label, international, multicenter, randomized trial of 297 patients with
      previously untreated, Rai stage I-IV B-CLL experiencing progression of their
      disease. Patients were randomized to either alemtuzumab, 30 mg i.v. over 2 hours
      three times per week on alternate days for a maximum of 12 weeks, or
      chlorambucil, 40 mg/m(2) orally every 28 days for a maximum of 12 months. The
      progression-free survival time, the primary study endpoint, was significantly
      longer in the alemtuzumab arm than in the chlorambucil arm. Both the overall and
      complete response rates were also significantly higher in the alemtuzumab arm. No
      differences in survival were observed. There were no new safety signals
      identified in patients receiving alemtuzumab. The most serious, and sometimes
      fatal, toxicities of alemtuzumab are cytopenias, infusion reactions, and
      infections.

TI  - Food and Drug Administration drug approval summary: Sunitinib malate for the
      treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumor and advanced renal cell carcinoma.
PG  - 107-13
AB  - On January 26, 2006, sunitinib (Sutent) received regular approval as monotherapy
      for the treatment of patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor after disease
      progression on or intolerance to imatinib mesylate (Gleevec). Time-to-tumor
      progression (TTP) of sunitinib-treated patients was superior to that of
      placebo-treated patients. Median TTP of sunitinib-treated patients was 27.3
      weeks, compared with 6.4 weeks for placebo-treated patients (p < .0001). Partial
      responses were observed in 6.8% of sunitinib-treated patients and no
      placebo-treated patients. Sunitinib also received accelerated approval on January
      26, 2006, as monotherapy for treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In
      two single-arm trials of sunitinib in patients with metastatic RCC, partial
      responses were observed in 25.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 17.5, 34.9) and
      36.5% (95% CI, 24.7, 49.6) of patients. Median response durations in the two
      trials were 27.1 weeks (95% CI, 24.4, incalculable) and 54 weeks (95% CI, 34.3,
      70.1). Treatment-emergent adverse events in sunitinib-treated patients included
      diarrhea, mucositis, skin abnormalities, altered taste, electrolyte
      abnormalities, hypertension, and diminution in left ventricular ejection
      fraction. Cardiac safety of sunitinib in patients with preexisting cardiac
      abnormalities remains unknown. Based on nonclinical findings, physicians
      prescribing sunitinib should monitor for adrenal insufficiency in patients who
      undergo stressors such as surgery, trauma, or severe infection. Caution should be
      exercised when administering sunitinib in combination with known CYP3A4 inducers
      or inhibitors.

TI  - Approval summary: imatinib mesylate capsules for treatment of adult patients with
      newly diagnosed philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia in
      chronic phase.
PG  - 1972-9
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose is to describe the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review
      and approval of imatinib (Gleevec; Novartis Pharmaceuticals, East Hanover, NJ)
      for treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia
      chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in chronic phase.
      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The FDA reviewed data in electronic format from a randomized
      controlled clinical trial of 1106 adult patients with newly diagnosed
      Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML in chronic phase, comparing imatinib with
      the combination of IFN-alpha and cytarabine. RESULTS: Imatinib showed clinically
      and statistically significantly better results for time-to-progression to
      accelerated phase or blast crisis, progression-free survival, complete
      hematological response rate, and cytogenetic response rate. With a median
      follow-up of 14 months, a maximum follow-up of 19.5 months, and an expected
      median survival of 5-6 years on the IFN-alpha/cytarabine control arm, few of the
      expected progressions to accelerated or blast phase or deaths have occurred.
      Imatinib was also better tolerated. Edema, nausea, rigors, neutropenia, and
      headache were more frequent in women. Only 57% of the IFN-alpha target dose was
      administered, and only 68% of patients received any cytarabine. However, this
      does not appear to adequately explain the superiority of imatinib observed in
      this trial. Results of a population pharmacokinetic study in a subgroup of 371
      patients and a separate rifampin-imatinib drug-drug interaction study in healthy
      volunteers are presented. CONCLUSIONS: On December 20, 2002, imatinib was granted
      accelerated approval under subpart H, rather than regular approval. Follow-up is
      short compared with the natural history of chronic phase CML or more mature
      results with established therapies such as IFN-alpha or transplantation. If
      imatinib should stop working after 1.5-2 years, the results could be importantly
      different from the present analysis. As a Phase IV postmarketing commitment, the
      applicant has agreed to provide follow-up reports on this imatinib study annually
      for the next 6 years.

      treatment of metastatic and/or unresectable malignant gastrointestinal stromal
      tumors (GISTs). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We discuss the efficacy and side effects of
      imatinib mesylate in a Phase II trial of 147 patients with metastatic and/or
      unresectable malignant GISTs, the basis for marketing approval, and postmarketing
      commitments by the drug's manufacturer. RESULTS: Imatinib was assessed in a
      single, open-label trial involving one European center and three centers in the
      United States. Seventy-three patients were randomly allocated to receive 400 mg
      of imatinib daily, and 74 patients received 600 mg daily. At the study report
      cutoff date, an objective response was confirmed in 56 patients; the overall
      response rate for the combined study arms was 38% (95% confidence interval,
      30-46%). These responses were all partial responses. There was no statistically
      significant difference in response rates between the two dose groups. Adverse
      events included edema, fluid retention, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, myalgias,
      skin rash, bone marrow suppression, bleeding, and elevations in aspartate
      aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, or bilirubin. Bleeding into the
      gastrointestinal tract or intratumoral sites occurred in 7 patients (5%) and was
      not correlated with thrombocytopenia or tumor bulk. The pharmacokinetics of
      imatinib in GIST patients were similar to those of chronic myelogenous leukemia
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: On February 1, 2001, imatinib mesylate was approved by the
      United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of malignant
      metastatic and/or unresectable GISTs. The recommended dose is 400 or 600 mg
      daily.
