TI  - Approval summary: imatinib mesylate in the treatment of metastatic and/or
      unresectable malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumors.
PG  - 3034-8
AB  - PURPOSE: Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec; Novartis, East Hanover, NJ)is a receptor
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved previously in 2001 by the United States Food
      and Drug Administration for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia in
      blast crisis, accelerated phase, or in chronic phase after failure of IFN-alpha
      therapy. We review herein the clinical profile of this drug and the regulatory
      review leading to the approval of a supplemental New Drug Application for the
      treatment of metastatic and/or unresectable malignant gastrointestinal stromal
      tumors (GISTs). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We discuss the efficacy and side effects of
      imatinib mesylate in a Phase II trial of 147 patients with metastatic and/or
      unresectable malignant GISTs, the basis for marketing approval, and postmarketing
      commitments by the drug's manufacturer. RESULTS: Imatinib was assessed in a
      single, open-label trial involving one European center and three centers in the
      United States. Seventy-three patients were randomly allocated to receive 400 mg
      of imatinib daily, and 74 patients received 600 mg daily. At the study report
      cutoff date, an objective response was confirmed in 56 patients; the overall
      response rate for the combined study arms was 38% (95% confidence interval,
      30-46%). These responses were all partial responses. There was no statistically
      significant difference in response rates between the two dose groups. Adverse
      events included edema, fluid retention, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, myalgias,
      skin rash, bone marrow suppression, bleeding, and elevations in aspartate
      aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, or bilirubin. Bleeding into the
      gastrointestinal tract or intratumoral sites occurred in 7 patients (5%) and was
      not correlated with thrombocytopenia or tumor bulk. The pharmacokinetics of
      imatinib in GIST patients were similar to those of chronic myelogenous leukemia
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: On February 1, 2001, imatinib mesylate was approved by the
      United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of malignant
      metastatic and/or unresectable GISTs. The recommended dose is 400 or 600 mg
      daily.
