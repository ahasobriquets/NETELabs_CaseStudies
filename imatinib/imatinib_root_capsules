TI  - Approval summary: imatinib mesylate capsules for treatment of adult patients with
      newly diagnosed philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia in
      chronic phase.
PG  - 1972-9
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose is to describe the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review
      and approval of imatinib (Gleevec; Novartis Pharmaceuticals, East Hanover, NJ)
      for treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia
      chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in chronic phase.
      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The FDA reviewed data in electronic format from a randomized
      controlled clinical trial of 1106 adult patients with newly diagnosed
      Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML in chronic phase, comparing imatinib with
      the combination of IFN-alpha and cytarabine. RESULTS: Imatinib showed clinically
      and statistically significantly better results for time-to-progression to
      accelerated phase or blast crisis, progression-free survival, complete
      hematological response rate, and cytogenetic response rate. With a median
      follow-up of 14 months, a maximum follow-up of 19.5 months, and an expected
      median survival of 5-6 years on the IFN-alpha/cytarabine control arm, few of the
      expected progressions to accelerated or blast phase or deaths have occurred.
      Imatinib was also better tolerated. Edema, nausea, rigors, neutropenia, and
      headache were more frequent in women. Only 57% of the IFN-alpha target dose was
      administered, and only 68% of patients received any cytarabine. However, this
      does not appear to adequately explain the superiority of imatinib observed in
      this trial. Results of a population pharmacokinetic study in a subgroup of 371
      patients and a separate rifampin-imatinib drug-drug interaction study in healthy
      volunteers are presented. CONCLUSIONS: On December 20, 2002, imatinib was granted
      accelerated approval under subpart H, rather than regular approval. Follow-up is
      short compared with the natural history of chronic phase CML or more mature
      results with established therapies such as IFN-alpha or transplantation. If
      imatinib should stop working after 1.5-2 years, the results could be importantly
      different from the present analysis. As a Phase IV postmarketing commitment, the
      applicant has agreed to provide follow-up reports on this imatinib study annually
      for the next 6 years.
