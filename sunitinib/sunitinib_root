TI  - Food and Drug Administration drug approval summary: Sunitinib malate for the
      treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumor and advanced renal cell carcinoma.
PG  - 107-13
AB  - On January 26, 2006, sunitinib (Sutent) received regular approval as monotherapy
      for the treatment of patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor after disease
      progression on or intolerance to imatinib mesylate (Gleevec). Time-to-tumor
      progression (TTP) of sunitinib-treated patients was superior to that of
      placebo-treated patients. Median TTP of sunitinib-treated patients was 27.3
      weeks, compared with 6.4 weeks for placebo-treated patients (p < .0001). Partial
      responses were observed in 6.8% of sunitinib-treated patients and no
      placebo-treated patients. Sunitinib also received accelerated approval on January
      26, 2006, as monotherapy for treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In
      two single-arm trials of sunitinib in patients with metastatic RCC, partial
      responses were observed in 25.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 17.5, 34.9) and
      36.5% (95% CI, 24.7, 49.6) of patients. Median response durations in the two
      trials were 27.1 weeks (95% CI, 24.4, incalculable) and 54 weeks (95% CI, 34.3,
      70.1). Treatment-emergent adverse events in sunitinib-treated patients included
      diarrhea, mucositis, skin abnormalities, altered taste, electrolyte
      abnormalities, hypertension, and diminution in left ventricular ejection
      fraction. Cardiac safety of sunitinib in patients with preexisting cardiac
      abnormalities remains unknown. Based on nonclinical findings, physicians
      prescribing sunitinib should monitor for adrenal insufficiency in patients who
      undergo stressors such as surgery, trauma, or severe infection. Caution should be
      exercised when administering sunitinib in combination with known CYP3A4 inducers
      or inhibitors.
